# Contributing

Tapir is an early stage project. Everything might change. All suggestions welcome :)

See the list of [issues](https://github.com/softwaremill/tapir/issues) and pick one! Or report your own.

If you are having doubts on the *why* or *how* something works, don't hesitate to ask a question on
[gitter](https://gitter.im/softwaremill/tapir) or via github. This probably means that the documentation, scaladocs or 
code is unclear and can be improved for the benefit of all.
