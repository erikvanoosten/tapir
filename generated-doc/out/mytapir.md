# Creating your own Tapir

Tapir uses a number of packages which contain either the data classes for describing endpoints or interpreters
of this data (turning endpoints into a server or a client). Importing these packages every time you want to use Tapir
may be tedious, that's why each package object inherits all of its functionality from a trait.

Hence, it is possible to create your own object which combines all of the required functionalities and provides
a single-import whenever you want to use tapir. For example:

```scala
object MyTapir extends Tapir
  with TapirAkkaHttpServer
  with TapirSttpClient
  with TapirJsonCirce
  with TapirOpenAPICirceYaml
  with TapirAliases
```

Then, a single `import MyTapir._` and all Tapir data types and extensions methods will be in scope!
